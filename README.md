Automated Sudoku Puzzle Solver

This was a persoal project I made to refresh my Python skills after not using them for several months.
After playing weeks of daily puzzles on my Good Sudoku app, I wanted to practice both my understanding of solving techniques and my python skills.
While not a necessary tool or even very conveinent, this was an enjoyable project to start, and I hope to have time to add more advanced solving techniques in the future.

To use, clone repository and add a .csv file with the sudoku puzzle, in the format of 9 rows x 9 columns, with each cell separated by a comma. 
A sample .csv file is attached.
